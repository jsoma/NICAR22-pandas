# Intro to data analysis using Pandas üêº (NICAR 2022)

We have two datasets we'll be working with: one is nice and simple and one is wild and fancy! The wild and fancy one is the same dataset that [is behind this Quartz story](https://archive.ph/GmQTC).

If you'd like to type along on your own computer, download this repo and load up either the notebook in the `simple-data` or `fancy-data` folder.

## ‚ö° Interactive versions

If it's too much work to get the notebook functioning on your computer, you can use Google Colab. It can run a Jupyter notebook in the cloud! The follow-along version has you type along with me for each and every step, while the pre-filled version you just run code that's already been typed in each cell.

* **Simple data:** [Follow-along version](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jsoma/NICAR22-pandas/blob/master/interactive/Introduction%20to%20pandas%20%28simple%20data%29.ipynb), [pre-filled version](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jsoma/NICAR22-pandas/blob/master/interactive/Introduction%20to%20pandas%20%28simple%20data%2C%20pre-filled%29.ipynb)
* **Fancy data:** [Follow-along version](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jsoma/NICAR22-pandas/blob/master/interactive/Introduction%20to%20pandas%20%28fancy%20data%29.ipynb), [pre-filled version](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jsoma/NICAR22-pandas/blob/master/interactive/Introduction%20to%20pandas%20%28fancy%20data%2C%20pre-filled%29.ipynb)

## üìù Completed versions

If you don't enjoy doing any work at all, an alternative is to just follow along with the 100% completed versions.
